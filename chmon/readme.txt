chmon is a port of "netmon" by hannenz to chameleon USB, with the following
differences:

- --ip option removed
- --send option added (send and start chmon.prg before running chmon)

the reu functionality is completely untested atm

have a look at the original readme for instructions on how to use the program

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

the binaries have been renamed so they can coexist with the regular netmon

netserv.prg -> chmon.prg
netmon.exe -> chmon.exe
