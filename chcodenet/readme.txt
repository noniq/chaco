This little program accepts the same options that grahams "codenet" client
supports, but instead works over the USB connection of the chameleon.

to get a list of options just run it without arguments:
$ ./chcodenet

The c64 must be running basic for some of the commands to work (since they
inject keypresses into the keyboard buffer). I recommend to just press reset
before using them :)
